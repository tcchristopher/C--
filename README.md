C++ is my first significant language outside of CS50x.
Why C++? I liked C more than Python and Javascript in CS50x. I hated that I couldn't see under the hood.
C is an amazing language but I wanted to learn a language that was 'modern' and I could use for developing apps and games.
C++ is that language. It's formidable and challenging and it represents a real committment from my side to programming.
Plus, I like Bjarne Stroustrup and his committment to programming and engineering.
So, here it is. I'm primarly learning from Stroustrup's Programming Principles and Practice as a means to establish wide-reaching programming and software engineering knowledge.
Looking forward to the end-version of myself after finishing the book and a few useful apps and games.
